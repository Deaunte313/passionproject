    <h1>The mind is made to astound</h1>
    <p>Every human is a compilation of development in 3 areas. We all have a responsibility to develop the areas for
      communal growth. This is a quick breakdown of what those 3 areas are and their optimal utilization in our
      communities and humanity as a whole. With biological growth, there are and will always be inevitabilities. with
      each
      form of development the variables are both conciously and unconciously chosen. The first component is gaining the
      most from the mental development you have to have a full evaluation of how you process thoughts. Secondly, the
      society in which you live determines the scope of with you view the people in the world around you and much more.
      Third and lastly, is the home life wherein you were raised and created, so age does play huge part in the
      recognition of each environment. All 3 are worlds within themselves. Each world needs to be cultivated, evaluated
      and challenged for propper growth as a whole. Again this is a brief synapsis of how to maximize each one in the
      hopes of unanimous recognition of value of collective planetary unity and socialogical development.</p>
