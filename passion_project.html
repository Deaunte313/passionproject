  <h1>THE TRINITY OF THE HUMAN</h1>
  
    <p>In my observations, every human I know is a compilation of development in 3 areas. We all have a responsibility to develop 
  these areas for societal growth. This is a quick breakdown of what those 3 areas are and their optimal utilization in our
  communities, home life and neurological development as a whole. With biological growth, there are and will always be inevitabilities. 
  With each stage of development the variables are both conciously and unconciously chosen. The first component in gaining the
  most from the individual mental development. You have to have a full psychological evaluation. Secondly, the
  society in which you live determines the scope of which you view the people in the world around you and much more. 
  This fact must be kept in consideration when processing your part in your community and home life.  Third and lastly, you must 
  understand the components in the home life, wherein you began development, so age, ethnicity, education etc., does play a huge 
  part in the recognition of each environment. All 3 are worlds within themselves. Each world needs to be cultivated, evaluated
  and challenged for propper growth as a whole. Again this is a brief synapsis of how to maximize each one in the
  hopes of an unanimous recognition of its value of collective functions planetary unity and socialogical development.</p>

  <h1>ABILITY TO PROCESS THOUGHT</h1>
  
  <p>Your ability to process thought is absolutely your own. It primarily is your navigator in both your home life and community.
    Your brain carries abilities that even the greatest scientist of all time have yet to reveal. 
    From the concept of memories to the imaginings of alternative existences, your mind is extraodinary. 
    Wouldn't you want to know where your mental ability really stands and how to maximize its potential?

  <h1>HOME LIFE</h1>
  
  Due to the complexities of one's home life, we will focus on the most pivotal developmental tools for the environment which is 
  provisions of Healthy Stimuli. Home life is essentially the floor plan of your characteristics for a personality. 
  Cleanliness, educational reading and a wide array of board games such as chess, mindtrap and boggle can drastically 
  increase sensibility, unity and most of all, it can fast track self awareness. From birth your home life can provide you with an impeccable path for growth.

  <h1>COMMUNITY</h1>
  
  <p>Every individual have to interact with their community at some point in time. Your interactions can be to build or to destroy. 
    When considering which option you intend to chose think of this. Even villains fall inlove and one day die. 
    Do you want to leave your child, pet, legacy in the hands of your enemies or your chosen family?</p>
